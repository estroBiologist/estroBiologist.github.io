	<h2><i>- game development -</i></h2>
	<p>i'm an experienced indie game developer. over the years, i've worked with engines like 
		GameMaker Studio, Clickteam Fusion, Unity and Godot, as well as writing (often very ambitious) hand-rolled games, frameworks and tools in C++.

	<h2><i>- programming -</i></h2>
	<p>speaking of C++: i am <i>far</i> more well-versed in that language than i'd like to be.
		although in recent years i've gravivated more towards newer languages like Rust, i've still got a boatload
		of experience on Bjarne Stroustrup's Wild Ride - as evidenced by my attempts to improve upon it
		with <a href="https://github.com/comune-lang/comune">comune</a>, my C++ successor language project.

	<h2><i>- music -</i></h2>
	<p>music is one of my biggest passions, and i think it shows. in addition to being a skilled composer and producer, i play guitar, drums, bass, piano, and sometimes i even try singing!
